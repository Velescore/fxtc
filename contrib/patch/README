## Patches ##
Patches are quite useful when merging our changes with the parent branch. These
patches can be applied to the original code to automatically add some of the 
changes made by Veles team. If the original code has change too much these
patches can be still useful to simplify manual update.

configure.ac.patch:	
 - patch for original configure.ac to compile additional tools (block testing 
   utility). Usage: patch configure.ac dev/configure.ac.patch

Makefile.am.patch:	
 - patch for src/Makefile.am to compile additional tools (block testing 
   utility). Usage: patch src/Makefile.am dev/Makefile.am.patch
